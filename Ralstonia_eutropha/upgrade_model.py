# Script to import and modify an SBML (systems biology markup
# language) model which describea the metabolism of a bacterial cell.
# This script performs the following basic steps
# 
#  - import cobra and other required libraries
#  - import an SBML model
#  - check key data of the model
#  - change constraints/reactants of erroneous reactions
#  - add reactions that were missing
#  - run a basic flux balance analysis (FBA)
#
# All of these functions are based on the COBRApy documentation.
# To install cobrapy for python3, navigate to your favorite directory 
# and execute the following lines in terminal:
#
# git clone https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy.git
# cd cobrapy-master/
# pip3 install -e

# TESTING FOR ENERGY GENERATING CYCLES ---------------------------------
#
# Energy generating cycles can generate ATP, NADPH or other energy/reducant 
# 'currency' of the cell out of thin air (see Fritzemeier et a., PLOS Comp Bio, 2017). 
# Such cycles represent factual errors of the model, and they 
# can occur when reactions are not correctly mass or charge balanced. 
# For example, one reaction converts a metabolite into another and a
# second reaction converts it back but this time generates ATP. Such cycles
# can even appear when reactions are correctly balanced, but one of the two 
# reactions would not normally occur because of thermodynamic restrictions 
# (far from equilibrium,) and therefore not reversible. FBA does not take
# thermodynamics into account but we can constrain reversibility as a fix.
